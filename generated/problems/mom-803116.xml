<statement>
<p>Josefa is conducting market research on the cost of  homeowners insurance. Josefa has determined that the average annual cost of  homeowners insurance is <dollar/>877, and that the distribution of costs is normally distributed with a standard deviation of <dollar/>83. </p>
<p>a. Find the probability that a single randomly selected consumer spends more than <dollar/>728 on  homeowners insurance.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><fillin characters="20" /></p>
<p>b. The cost of the middle 40<percent/> of  homeowners insurance policies falls between (round to the nearest dollar):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><dollar/><fillin characters="20" /> to <dollar/><fillin characters="20" /> per year.</p>
<p>c. The <em>most expensive </em>6<percent/> of  homeowners insurance policies cost at least how much annually?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><dollar/><fillin characters="20" /></p>

<solution>
<p><ul><li>0.9637</li><li>833</li><li>921</li><li>1006</li></ul></p><p>Define the normal distribution in Desmos: <m>\displaystyle{N}=\text{normaldist}{\left({877},{83}\right)}</m>.</p>
<p>a. <m>\displaystyle{P}{\left({x}{>}{728}\right)}={N}.{c}{d}{f{{\left({728},\infty\right)}}}={0.9637}</m></p>
<p>b. For the middle 40<percent/> of the data, need the remaining 60<percent/> of the data split between the left and right tails of the distribution. So the lower bound of the range has <m>\displaystyle{0.3}</m> of the area to the left and the upper bound of the range has <m>\displaystyle{0.3}</m> of the area to the right, which means <m>\displaystyle{0.7}</m> to the left. Therefore:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Lower bound <m>\displaystyle={N}.\text{inversecdf}{\left({0.3}\right)}={833}</m></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Upper bound <m>\displaystyle={N}.\text{inversecdf}{\left({0.7}\right)}={921}</m></p>
<p>c. For the most expensive 6<percent/> of the distribution, need <m>\displaystyle{0.06}</m> of the area to the right of the data value, so need <m>\displaystyle{1}-{0.0}{.06}={0.94}</m> to the left. Therefore:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"> <m>\displaystyle{x}={N}.\text{inversecdf}{\left({0.94}\right)}={1006}</m> </p>
</solution>
