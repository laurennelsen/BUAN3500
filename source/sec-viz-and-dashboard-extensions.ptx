  <subsection xml:id="subsec-Sankey-chart">
    <title>Sankey Chart using a Viz Extension in Tableau</title>

    <p>
        An example of a chart that can be made using a <em>Viz Extension</em> in Tableau is a <em>Sankey Chart</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        (This is a relatively new feature from a couple years ago.)
    </p>

<p>
    Sankey charts can be helpful for showing <q>flow</q>, such as the flow of money like in the image below from the budgeting software <em>Monarch</em>.
</p>

    <p>

    </p>


    <p>
        We're going to see how to use a Viz Extension in Tableau to create a Sankey chart.
    </p>


    <exercise>
        <p>
            Use a Viz extension in Tableau to create a Sankey chart for the 2023 NBA playoff data below to get an image like the one shown.
        </p>

        <p>
            <url href="external/sheets/2023 NBA Playoffs.xlsx" />
        </p>


        <p>
            <image source="sheets/NBASankey.png" width="100%">
            </image>
        </p>

        <p>
            Questions to consider:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Is this the best way to visualize this data?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        What is wrong with the way colors are being used in this chart?  (How could the chart be improved?)
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </exercise>



    <exercise>
    <p>
        The file below contains information about some of the passengers on the Titanic and whether or not they survived.
         <url href="external/sheets/titanic.csv" />

    </p>
        <p>
            Use a viz extension in Tableau to create a Sankey chart like the one below:
            <image source="sheets/TitanicSankey.png" width="100%">
</image>
        </p>
        <p>
            (You'll need to create a calculated field.)
        </p>

    <title>Dashboard Extensions in Tableau</title>


    <p>
        We've made dashboards in Tableau, but there are a lot of extensions that can take our dashboards to the next level.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the problem below, we're going to use the <em>Image Map Filter</em> dashboard extension in Tableau. 
    </p>


    <exercise>
        <p>
            In this problem, we're going to create a dashboard like the one at the link below:
        </p>
        <p>
            <url href="https://public.tableau.com/views/Superstoredashboard_17331671994430/Dashboard1?:language=en-USpublish=yes:sid=:redirect=auth:display_count=n:origin=viz_share_link" >
Link to Dashboard </url>            
</p>
<p>
    To do this, we'll need the Excel file with the data, as well as the image that we're using to represent the different categories:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Excel file:   <url href="external/sheets/Sample - Superstore.xls" />

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Image:  <url href="external/sheets/CategoryImage.png" />
               
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
        <p>
            Create two charts in Tableau:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        A map shading each state with the total profit
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        A line chart showing profit over time
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            Add <q>Category</q> to <em>Filters</em> on both of these sheets.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now create a dashboard and add both of these sheets to your dashboard.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next we're going to add the <q>Image Map Filter</q> extension to the dashboard:
        </p>

        <p>
            <image source="sheets/DashboardExtension.png" width="100%">
            </image>
        </p>

    </exercise>
