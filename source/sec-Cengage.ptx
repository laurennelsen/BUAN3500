  <introduction>
    <p>
        Some of your homework assignments are going to be through something called MindTap, but you will access them through Canvas.
    </p>

    <p>
        <em>The first time you launch the homework:</em>
        Launch Cengage the first time FROM the link in Canvas instead of going to the Cengage website directly. 
        </p>
        <p>
        (This ensures syncing of the new student identifier and proper grade pass back.)
