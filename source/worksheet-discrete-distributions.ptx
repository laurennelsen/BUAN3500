    <p>
        The outcomes of a binomial experiment and the corresponding probabilities of these outcomes are called a <em>binomial distribution</em>.

        </p>

        <p>

The probability of exactly <m>X</m> successes in <m>n</m> trials with probability of success, <m>p</m>, is
<me> P(X) = {n\choose X}p^X(1-p)^{n-X}\text{  for } X=0,1,2,...,n </me>

where <m> {n\choose X}=\frac{n!}{X!(n-X)!}</m>.
    </p>


<p>
    Good news!  The mean and standard deviation of a binomial distribution are simple computations:
<me>\mu = np\text{ and } \sigma=\sqrt{npq} </me>

</p>

<p>

As the number of trials in a binomial experiment increases, calculating the probabilities required using the complex formula becomes tedious.  Therefore, we will compute probabilities using Excel formulas.

</p>
<p>
    In Excel:
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>\text{The formula is } BINOM.DIST(x,n,p,\text{cumulative})\text{, where }\text{cumulative=TRUE (<m>x</m> or fewer successes) or FALSE (exactly <m>x</m> successes)}</m>
    </p>
    <p>
    <me>\boxed{ P(X\leq x)=BINOM.DIST(x,n,p,TRUE)\;\;\;\text{ and }\;\;\; P(X=x)=BINOM.DIST(x,n,p,FALSE) }</me>

            We might want to understand how busy traffic is near campus.  Let's say that we stand at the intersection of Clyde Way and Austin Bluffs Parkway and count how many cars drive by on Austin Bluffs from noon-1pm on a particular day.  Is this a binomial experiment?

    A bank expects to receive six bad checks per day, on average. What is the probability of the bank getting fewer than five bad checks on any given day? Of interest is the number of checks the bank receives in one day, so the time interval of interest is one day. Let <m>X=</m> the number of bad checks the bank receives in one day. If the bank expects to receive six bad checks per day then the average is six checks per day. Which of the following is a mathematical statement for the probability question.

              The outcome for the random variable for a <em>Poisson distribution</em> is the actual number of occurrences of an event over a period of time, area, distance, or any other type of measurement.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              The probability of exactly <m>X</m> occurrences over a given interval is:
              <me>P(X)=\frac{\lambda^Xe^{-\lambda}}{X!}\text{, where <m>\lambda=</m>the mean number of occurrences over the interval.}</me>
            </p>
    
            <p>
              The mean and standard deviation of a Poisson distribution are even simpler than what we saw for a binomial distribution:
              <me>\boxed{ \mu=\lambda }\text{   and   }\boxed{\sigma=\sqrt{\lambda}}</me>
            </p>
            <p>
              Once again, we will usually use Excel or tables to compute probabilities associated with Poisson distributions.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              (Here is a link to a table that you can use as well: <url href="https://ux1.eiu.edu/~aalvarado2/levine-smume6_topic_POIS.pdf" />.  Make sure to pay attention to if any table you're using is giving you a cumulative probability or not.)
            </p>
            <p>
              In Excel, we'll use the formula:
              <me>\boxed{POISSON.DIST(x,\lambda,\text{cumulative})}</me>
              where cumulative=TRUE (<m>x</m> or fewer occurrences) or FALSE (exactly <m>x</m> occurrences).
