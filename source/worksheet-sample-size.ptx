    <title>Determining the Sample Size</title>

    <p>
       How large a sample is necessary to make an accurate estimate?  The answer is not simple, since it depends on three things:
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                The confidence level
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The standard deviation
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The margin of error
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

<p>
    
The more confident we want to be, the wider we want our interval, but there is a tradeoff.  If an interval is too wide, it provides little information.  On the other hand, a narrow interval requires a larger sample size and sampling can be a costly procedure.  Hence, it is handy to be able to be able to calculate ahead of time the sample size required to achieve a specified margin of error.  With a bit of algebra on the appropriate margin of error from the confidence interval formula, we can determine the sample size.

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                The formula when working with a mean is <m>n=\frac{(z_{\alpha/2})^2\sigma^2}{(ME_{\overline{x}})^2}</m> where <m>ME_{\overline{x}}</m> is the desired margin of error.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Similarly, the formula when working with a proportion is <m>n=\frac{(z_{\alpha/2})^2\overline{p}(1-\overline{p})}{(ME_{\overline{p}})^2}</m> where <m>ME_{\overline{p}}</m> is the desired margin of error.

            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <em>If necessary, round the answer up to obtain a whole number.  If you round down, then you won't achieve the desired margin of error.</em>

<p>
Determine the sample size needed to construct a <m>99\%</m> confidence interval to estimate the average GPA for the student population at a college with a margin of error equal to 0.5.  Assume the standard deviation of the GPA for the student population is 2.5.

   <p>
A certain region would like to estimate the proportion of voters who intend to participate in upcoming elections.  A pilot sample of 50 voters found that 39 of them intended to vote in the election.  Determine the additional number of voters that need to be sampled to construct a <m>96\%</m> interval with a margin of error equal to 0.08 to estimate the proportion.
