        Download the Tableau Workbook below that includes data from the 2023 National Survey of Children’s Health.  Here is a link to information about the dataset:  <url href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/nsch/technical-documentation/codebook/2023-NSCH-Screener-Variable-List.pdf">Link to information about variables</url>

        Let's look at the proportion of children who need or currently take medication, which is labeled <q>C_K2Q10</q>.  We want to find the number of responses with a "<q>1</q>" and divide by the total number of responses.
    </p>
    <p>
        We've practiced doing things like this in Excel, but Tableau is a little different.
    </p>

    <p>
        Use ChatGPT or Copilot and ask <q>If I have a variable labeled C_K2Q10, how would I calculate the proportion of responses that were a "1" in a calculated field in Tableau?</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        Check to see if you get the answer below, and then create this calculated field in Tableau.
    </p>


    <answer>
        <p>
            SUM(IF [C K2Q10]=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/COUNT([C K2Q10])

        </p>
    </answer>

        Continue working with the Tableau Workbook from the previous problem that includes data from the 2023 National Survey of Children’s Health, and now create a calculated field for the proportion of children who need or get special therapy such as physical, occupational, or speech therapy.  (This is in <q>C_K2Q19</q>.)
    </p>

    <answer>
        <p>
            SUM(IF [C K2Q19]=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/COUNT([C K2Q19])
        </p>
    </answer>

        Use the calculated fields you found in the last two exercises and make a table containing those values.
