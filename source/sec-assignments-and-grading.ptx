    Grading and providing feedback on your assignments and activities may take up to a week. If I need more time, I will let you know when to expect a response.

    <title>Missed/Late Work</title>

    <p>
        I do not have to allow make-ups or accept late work, but I often consider them according to each student's situation.  I strongly recommend asking me for extensions if you find yourself needing them.  In general, communicating with me earlier rather than later about your situation makes it more likely that we can make some kind of arrangement appropriate to your situation.   Let me know as soon as possible if you are going to miss a quiz or exam.   If you don't notify me in advance of your absence, or if you do not have a valid excuse, you may not be allowed to make up the assignment/assessment, and you may receive a score of zero for that assignment/assessment.

    <title>Attendance</title>

    <p>
        It is the expectation of the College of Business that students will attend all classes. However, specific classroom attendance policies are left to the discretion of the instructors. Students are responsible for knowing the attendance policies of their individual instructors. Business instructors may drop students who do not attend the first class of the semester. This policy allows waitlisted students who do attend the first class to be added to the class. Students registering for classes after the first class must obtain approval from the instructor prior to enrolling in the class.
    </p>
    <p>
Class attendance is an important part of the educational process in this course.  Our class time is valuable, and you’re expected to attend class regularly if you are able (and not sick).  Talk to me if you have concerns about this.  
</p>
<p>
The material builds on itself, so I really don’t want you to fall behind.  If something comes up, such as illness, that prevents you from attending class, then let me know as soon as possible.
